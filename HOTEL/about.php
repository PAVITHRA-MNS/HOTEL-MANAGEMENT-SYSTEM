<div>
<b><p3 style="color:white;">While the emphasis lay on building an environment-friendly ‘green’ Resort, he also ensured that the property’s historical value was carefully preserved. Thus, the first venture into Hospitality sector was initiated through an association with Aitken Spence, Sri Lanka, and a separate company, ETL Hospitality Services Limited, was formed . Later in the year 2010, the company was re-christened as Grand Luxe Hotels Limited to manage and market Heritage Madurai and accelerate the growth of the Hospitality Division.</p3></b>

<div>
<b><p4 style="color:white;">Restoration of the Madurai Club was fittingly awarded to Bawa’s disciple, Sri Lankan architect and prodigy Vinod Jayasinghe. Maintaining Bawa’s unique style and most of the material he had used, Jayasinghe restored the resort to its former glory, along with the addition of modern conveniences. Leaving his own personal stamp on the project, Jayasinghe, in addition to personal courtyards and enclosed plunge pools in every villa, added an Olympic-sized, temple tank styled pool.</p4></b>
